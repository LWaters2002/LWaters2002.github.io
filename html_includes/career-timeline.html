                    Since I was a young teen, I've always enjoyed the practice of making games from my first steps in scratch,
                    crawling through and learning gamemaker and then ending up with unreal and unity when I was 15.
                    During this time you would always find me hosting a games club during my school lunch breaks.

                    The University gave me the brilliant freedom and guidance to nurture my existing passion for games,
                    during this time throughout Uni I became well trained across the games disciplines with a heavy focus into programming.
                    Additionally during this time I had the wonderful chance to colloborate with dozens of talented individuals in game jams and group projects.

                    I don't know the exact place I will be in years to come, However I know that I will be far more experienced than I am now.
                    and maybe you can help me gain that experience :)
