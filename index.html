            <h4>Hey, I'm Liam!</h4>
            <p>I'm a gameplay and tooling engineer!
              <br><br>
              I'm extremely passionate across the discplines that make up the game pipeline
              and I find myself to be quite the tech head wanting to dive
              into any new technology or feature available to me!
              <br><br>
              outside of work I have a love of birds and nature,
              where I find myself going on hikes or visiting the local parks
              and when I can get some time I also enjoy playing my guitar.

          , where you have to heal the monster instead of hunt it. This creates an interesting dynamic due to the creature getting stronger as the fight goes on in an intuitive way.
          during this project I tackled the fool end-to-end process from sculpting, animating, texturing and programming all combat and survival behaviours" image="images/monsteranger.jpg"
