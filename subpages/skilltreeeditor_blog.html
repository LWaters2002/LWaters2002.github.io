        <h5>Why Sustainable Tooling Matters in Unity Projects</h5>
        <p>
            Game development can be chaotic, especially as deadlines approach and crunch time looms. There are many ways
            to manage this chaosâ€”some preventative, some reactive. Tooling is a key preventative measure that can help
            keep projects on track and teams productive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's start by identifying common problems that arise in growing Unity projects :
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Lengthy end-to-end processes</li>
            <li>Difficulty finding related project files</li>
            <li>Inconsistent assets and project setup</li>
            <li>Unclear or unenforced guidelines</li>
            <li>Wasting time searching through project files</li>
            <br>
            Now that we've identified our problems; we can figure out our solutions.
            <br><br>
            <li>Automate repetitive steps</li>
            <li>using a dedicated asset editor / finder</li>
            <li>creating Asset validators and Fixers</li>
            <br>
            Just through breaking down problems and presenting simple solutions you can reduce the amount of error and
            debt in your project and in turn dramatically improve the way your project scales.
            <br><br>
            Imagine you had thousands upon thousands of files, immediately there's an issue here; Searching and finding
            for what you want becomes a problem in and of itself and creates this friction between the actual important
            work
            that needs to be done and simply navigating the project.
            <br><br>This is a core issue as this becomes a hindrance to every member of the team. As the project grows
            the
            things that were previously possible are simply not sustainable anymore.
            This is why assistive tooling is vital to having a scalable and sustainable project, as they help mitigate
            one of the core struggles of a large project.

        </ul>
        <h5>Principles for Scalable, Sustainable Unity Tooling</h5>
        <p>
            These principles will help you make the right decisions when planning tooling. They focus on assistive
            tooling rather than content tooling as that already has a given purpose
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>A tool must solve a problem:</strong> Tools should solve a purpose, if it has no valid purpose
                then it shouldn't be a thing; The last thing you want is to add additional technical debt to your
                project.
            </li> <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Enable Quality and Efficiency:</strong> Tools should allow for faster iteration, higher quality
                output, or the ability to handle more work. If a tool doesn't provide a clear benefit in one of these
                areas, reconsider its value. Focus on measurable improvements to workflow or results.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Simplify Complex Content Pipelines:</strong> Good tools break down complicated processes into
                manageable steps, making it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain consistency.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Reduce Interdisciplinary Dependencies:</strong> Tools should minimize bottlenecks between
                disciplines, allowing artists, designers, and programmers to work simultaneously without wasteful
                overlaps.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h5>Common Tooling Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them</h5>
        <p>It's easy for tooling to look like the key to success however as with everything it needs to be kept in
            moderation.
            Below are some core pitfalls to lookout for :
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard to find:</strong> It may be tempting to stick all your tools in one place, however tools
                should be stored on a context basis. This means that the tool can always be found with the associated
                asset or browser, for example a texture validator should be able to be opened via a right click context
                menu for a texture.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Fights the engine:</strong> A good tool shouldn't find or introduce different complexities to
                existing workflows,
                the purpose of the assistive tool is to simplify the end to end pipeline not to replace it. </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Having multiple jobs:</strong> Keep your tools sweet and simple, as soon as a tool expands past
                it's initial purpose it starts becoming it's own project with it's own maintenance bugs and so on. </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Overly Complex:</strong> This goes by the general principle of "keep it simple", tooling still
                requires it's own maintenance and it's own time-sink, due to a projects dependancies on it's tooling you
                never want to be in a position where a tools technical debt is haulting the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By avoiding this principles, it should allow you to plan out hassle-free tooling that allows for a project
            to
            scale in a healthy manner; make sure you are always paying attention to your toolings place in your project
            as it serves to assist not to hinder.</p>
