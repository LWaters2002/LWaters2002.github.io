        <h5>What makes gamification special ? </h5>
        Gamification turns tough concepts into approachable challenges by weaving them into familiar, game-like
        experiences. With a tight reward-feedback loop, users earn small wins as they work toward a bigger goalâ€”keeping
        motivation high.
        <br><br>
        Because games are interactive, they strengthen learning by letting users actively apply knowledge and get
        instant feedback. This converts frustrating and cumbersome activities in enjoyable and nourishing experiences.

        For example take a language app such as duolingo, it is an extremely gamified language learning app;
        We can see this constantly in it's use of sound effects, reward animations and use of video game centric
        mechanics such as lives and points. This keeps user retention high and is one of the core values to duolingo's
        success. However whilst retention is important how good is the quality of learning for the end user ?
        <br><br>
        <h5>Gamification isn't perfect, and here's why </h5>

        Gamification presents itself as a brilliant solution for keeping learners engaged, however it's critical flaw is
        that by making things easier and reductive we can lose the inherant substance of what we are learning;
        This can lead to learners having shallow roots in their knowledge, this is because the struggle and effort put
        into an activity correlates with our braining growing new pathways for said activity.

        but this isn't null and void, given the correct execution and by balancing the level of gamification, we can get
        the best of both worlds. We can use gamification to increase retention, build consistency and break down complex
        topics into digestable segments whilst using more traditional methods such as writing, quizzing and studying to
        form a solid foundation for a user.

        <br><br>

        In conclusion, Gamification is a powerful tool that needs the correct execution as whilst it can nurture a
        perfect environment for learning it can also trivalise and reduce the importance of the subject matter causing
        no meaningful connections to be made between the brain and the content that is being studied.

        <h5>Try out some gamified learning experiences yourself!</h5>
        I've used these websites to improve my skills are give me a headstart into something intimidating and to help
        give relatively abstract tools a tangible environment to practice in.
