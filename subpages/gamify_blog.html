        <h5>What makes gamification special ? </h5>
        <p>Gamificiation allows us to tackle tough concepts by inserting them into familiar and approachable
            applications, this is because games often have a very tight reward feedback loop. Meaning the user is
            gradually rewarded for their efforts towards an overall goal.
            <br><br>
            Additionally due to games being an interactive medium this helps form stronger relationships within the
            brain when accomplishing the task as we can actively test a user's knowledge or skill.
